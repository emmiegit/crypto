## crypto

If you're here for [cryptocommodities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency), go away. This is about _actual_ crypto, the beautiful mathematics and art of **cryptography**.

Here, I try to implement my own cryptosystems to understand the fundamental concepts better, or reimplement well-known systems. That means you **should not** use this code for anything! Not even for a hobby project!

**NOTHING HERE IS SECURE!** I'm writing this for fund and education purposes, not to be used. Go use regular, well-established ciphers and protocols. AES for symmetric-key encryption, bcrypt for password hashing, etc. If you use anything here, I guarantee your data will be stolen and your authentication broken.
